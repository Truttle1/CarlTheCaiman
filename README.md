# Carl the Caiman: The Ten Dollar Bill of Glory

A game by Truttle1!

## PLOT

A long long time ago, the Ten Dollar Bill of Glory was printed. It must have been important, after all, the phrase “of Glory” 
was included in its name. The Bill, however, has found its way into the evil clutches of Literally Satan. Carl the Caiman, 
upon learning about this mysterious artifact from the back page of some random tabloid, takes a few weeks of vacation time 
from his boring day job (specifically, all the vacation time he has for the whole year) to find his way to Flipping Hell, 
defeat Literally Satan, and reclaim the Ten Dollar Bill of Glory for his town of Marshall City...primarily so he can stop working at his boring day job. Carl’s species, the Caiman, if you don't know what that is, is sort of like a crocodile, but sort of also like an alligator.
